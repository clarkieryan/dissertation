#Background and objectives

###Events industry 

The UK music events and festival industry was estimated at 2.3 billion and expected to raise to 3.4 billion in 2015. With roughly 530,000 full time equivalent jobs employed by 25,000 employers . These events themselves are very diverse, from a personal recitals to live DJ sets in the O2 arena. The industry itself is very diverse with a huge range of events going on every night, from personal recitals to all night techno raves, many people find themselves going to the same venue over and over again not aware of other events happening around them. Currently the promotion of events is limited to the users of certain social media sites, or purpose built websites for promotion of events. The tools that a promoter currently has at their disposal is limited and sporadic at the best, for an example a The Rainbow Venues use a mixture of their own site, social media (Facebook/Twitter) and the ticket masters. This brings to the core problem for a potential customer to discover the venue, they must be aware of the venue first to be able to find the information that they want. Even with use of social media the reach of a promoted event will only reach those that know of the venue or by those that 'share' the promotion to their friends. 

###Project Overview

The application itself is a tool to facilitate the discovery of events that are being promoted throughout the various tools these events companies use. By compiling a list of events from various data feeds such as Facebooks/Ticketmasters/Google Places API's I can aggregate this information and almost make a master list of the events going on at any point anywhere. This will be the primary USP of the application and will help to drive the users to using the service, when viewing a particular event a user will be able to follow an event or venue giving them notifications about changes to and event and upcoming events at a venue. By analysing this data I can create a feed of recommended events that a user may be interested in, this feed will also use information from people that are similar to them to help suggest new events. 

This application will require a server module to require it running, this will assist with the aggregation of the data and amount of data processing required by the service. The server module will be split into two parts the data mining section which will concern the the acquisition of the data from the various API's, and an API that the application will interface with to retrieve the relevant information. The API will be primarily developed with the view of the application, however I do have the ability for other people to have access to this API, therefore there are a few security requirements I need to adhere to.
