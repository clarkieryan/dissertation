\chapter{Implementation}The implementation should look at any issues you encountered as you tried to implement your design. During the work, you might have found that elements of your design were unnecessary or overly complex; perhaps third party libraries were available that simplified some of the functions that you intended to implement. If things were easier in some areas, then how did you adapt your project to take account of your findings?It is more likely that things were more complex than you first thought. In particular, were there any problems or difficulties that you found during implementation that you had to address? Did such problems simply delay you or were they more significant? You can conclude this section by reviewing the end of the implementation stage against the planned requirements. % ISSUE - Following needed to be outputted along with an event's details for lower % ISSUE - Developing the personalised feed% ISSUE - Password hashing, storing the salt with the password, is more secure. % ISSUE - Search functionality - limitations with it. % ISSUE - REST Vs SOAP%ISSUE - JSON Vs XML
