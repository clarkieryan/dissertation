This report describes When visiting  a new area trying to find out what's going on can be difficult even for the most adept regular. Tonight tries to solve that problem by providing a mobile application that allows you to discover events that are going on around you. It does this by presenting the user with events that may be of interest to them via a `My Feed' section. A user also has the ability to explore events by selecting a city/area then drilling down to a particular venue or category. The users is then able to view all of the details on a particular event, with the option to follow the event. By following an event the system can learn about the user and present them with suggestions of events, based on what similar users are also following. To do this I developed a Ruby on Rails server application that provided a REST based API to access the information that a user needed, as part of this I also developed a data mining module to be able to pull in information from various data sources. Using this in conjunction with an iOS application to present the data and add in functionality to the user on a mobile device.
